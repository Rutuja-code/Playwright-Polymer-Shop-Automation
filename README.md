## Why this framework exists

This repository is a portfolio-grade automation framework built to demonstrate how a senior SDET or QA automation architect would structure a maintainable, scalable, and interview-worthy Playwright solution for a real product team. The goal is not just to automate a demo shop, but to show disciplined engineering: modular design, reusable abstractions, reliable test data, reporting, CI integration, and security-minded practices.

## Professional GitHub presentation

This repository is structured to feel like a production-ready engineering asset for recruiters, hiring managers, and technical reviewers. It includes:
- a polished GitHub banner and badges
- a professional README and architecture story
- contributor and review templates
- release automation and dependency updates
- security-focused CI workflows

## Ownership and branding

Maintainer: Rutuja Raikar

This framework is designed to be professionally presented in GitHub, interviews, and enterprise-style technical reviews. For branding and protection:
- use the MIT license for code reuse
- add a trademark for product names or framework branding if you want commercial protection
- retain copyright attribution in the repository files

## Architecture overview

fixtures/             -> custom Playwright fixtures
helpers/              -> logger, retry-aware utilities
utils/                -> assertions, waits, screenshots, state capture
constants/            -> routes, selectors, and shared values
data/                 -> JSON-driven test data
config/               -> environment configuration

## Framework highlights

- Page Object Model and Component Object Model
- Reusable fixtures and abstraction layers
- Cross-browser and mobile execution
- HTML, Allure, screenshot, video, and trace reporting on failure
- Environment-based configuration using dotenv
- Stronger assertions and reusable utilities for maintainable tests
- Security-focused repository hygiene and CI checks
- Designed for maintainability, reliability, and interview readiness

## Tech stack

- Playwright Test
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- dotenv
- Allure
- GitHub Actions
- Winston logging

## Project structure

- pages/: page objects for home, category, product, and cart flows
- components/: shared UI components such as header and footer
- fixtures/: test fixture wiring for application objects
- utils/: reusable helpers for waits, assertions, screenshots, and context capture
- constants/: centralized routes and selectors
- data/: JSON-driven test data for products and users
- config/: environment management
- reports/: outputs for execution artifacts and reporting

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

## Local execution

```bash
npm test
npm run test:smoke
npm run test:sanity
npm run test:regression
npm run test:headed
npm run test:debug
```

## Cross-browser execution

```bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=firefox
npx playwright test --project=webkit
npx playwright test --project=mobile-chromium
```

## Reporting

```bash
npm run report
npm run allure:report
```

## CI/CD

The repository includes:
- a Playwright workflow for automated execution on push and pull request
- a security workflow for dependency auditing and secret scanning
- artifact upload for HTML reports, test results, and Allure output

## Security posture

Security considerations are built into the repository by design:
- secrets stay in environment variables and example files only
- dependency auditing is part of CI
- logs and artifacts are kept clean and non-sensitive
- the repo includes a dedicated security policy

## Custom engineering-style utility

The framework includes a lightweight context-capture utility in [utils/test-context.ts](utils/test-context.ts) that captures the current URL and page title for better debugging and more intentional test diagnostics.

## Pre-push checklist

Before pushing to GitHub, confirm the following:
- [ ] all tests pass locally
- [ ] dependency audit is clean
- [ ] security workflow is configured and visible
- [ ] README and ownership details are complete
- [ ] no secrets are committed
- [ ] reports and local artifacts are not published unintentionally
- [ ] the repository looks polished enough for recruiter and hiring-manager review
